# Quantum-AI Path Planning System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an integrated system that applies **quantum computing concepts**, **artificial intelligence**, and **containerization** to solve and analyze a grid-based path planning problem.

The system compares classical and quantum-inspired approaches for path planning and presents the results in a structured and explainable manner. The entire application is containerized to ensure reproducibility and ease of deployment.

## Objectives
- To understand and apply **quantum computing basics** and **quantum gates & circuits**
- To integrate **LLM-based explanation** with structured data storage
- To ensure reproducible execution using **Docker containerization**
- To develop a modular and easy-to-understand academic project
